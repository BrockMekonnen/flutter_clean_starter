# Flutter Clean Starter

Welcome to the **Flutter Clean Starter** – a production-ready, modular, and scalable Flutter project template built using **Clean Architecture** principles.

- Clean architecture layers (data, domain, features)  
- Modular code organization  
- Support for mobile and web  
- Localization, theme, and routing setup  
- Mock API server for quick prototyping

## 📁 Folder Structure Overview

Here's a simplified version of the core project structure:

```
lib/  
├── __tests__/  
├── _core/  
├── _shared/
